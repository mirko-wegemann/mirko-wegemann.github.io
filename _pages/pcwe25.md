    <h3>Content</h3><br>
    <p>This seminar zeros in on the role of political parties for democracies in Western Europe. After a brief recap on their origins and functions in the democratic system, we will proceed in three blocks. In a first block, we will focus on the demand side, discussing existing approaches explaining voting behaviour. Do voters try to maximize their own utility when voting for a party or do they rather follow their peers or more emotional motives? We will then proceed by analysing political parties as strategic actors. How do parties find their niche in existing party systems, under which conditions do they decide to change their position on a political issue? Finally, in a third block, we will discuss the impact of political institutions, such as the electoral system, on party competition. When do electoral systems increase party system fragmentation, which systems lead to a personalization of political parties? </p>

	<h3>Material</h3>
	<br>
    <h4>Crash course on R</h4>
    There are various YouTube tutorials and <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/">Handbooks</a> you can consult to learn R. I also created a very simple introductory script you could download alongside the sample data to get a first glimpse into basic functions of R. <br>

	<h4>Week 1: Introduction</h4>
	In this session, we will get to know each other and discuss some logistics about the seminar. Moreover, a brief introduction into the topic is given.  <br>

	<h4>Week 2: Concepts</h4>
	In this session, we will discuss the method of comparison in political science and introduce some key concepts in the study of party competition. <br>

	<h4>Week 3: Political Cleavages</h4>
	Have the conflict lines in Western societies changed over times? We will discuss the idea of political cleavages and their recent transformations.  <br>

	<h4>Week 4: Polarization</h4>
	Do Western societies become more polarized? How do actors like the far-right contribute to polarization? We will first deal with these questions before discussing data sources on voters we can use to analyse voters. <br>

    <h4>Week 5: Changing Contexts</h4>
    How did globalization affect citizens' grievances? Do those losing from labor market transformations vote for anti-system parties? We will approach these questions from two empirical readings on technological change and labor market risk. <br>

    <h4>Week 7: Issue Competition</h4> 
    In this week, we will switch the perspective and focus on the strategic behavior of political parties. In the first session of this bloc, we will focus on issue competition of parties.

    <h4>Week 8: Social Groups</h4> 
    Do parties appeal to social groups directly? We will engage with two strategies parties can employ: (1) group references and (2) strategic appointments of group representatives, and evaluate whether these affects parties' electoral fortunes.  <br>

    <h4>Week 9: Challenger Parties</h4> 
    In this week, we zoom in on the interactions between challenger and mainstream parties. We critically evalute different conceptualizations of challengers and learn how they innovate the party system agenda.  <br>
