<h1> Mirko Wegemann </h1><br>
I am a PhD Researcher at the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences">Department of Social and Political Sciences</a>, situated at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Currently, I am on a research stay at the <a href="https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics">DYNAMICS Research Training Group</a>, jointly organized by the Humboldt University of Berlin and Hertie School of Governance. <br>
My main research interests lie in the field of comparative politics. Much of my work revolves around party competition in Western Europe, with a specific focus on challenger parties and their programmatic diversification. More recently, I have worked on other aspects of political behaviour such as gender and politics and citizens' perceptions of policy justifications. Methodologically, my empirical work is based on quantiative methods, computational text analysis and experimental research. <br>
In my dissertation project "Roads to the Mainstream.", which is supervised by <a href="https://www.eui.eu/people?id=ellen-margaretha-immergut">Prof. Ellen M. Immergut</a>, I analyse how challenger parties like the Greens and Radical Right evolve. More specifically, I investigate under which conditions they diversify their programmatic portfolio, when they approach new constituencies and how broadening their appeal may affect their electoral success. <br>
I did my pre-doctoral studies at the Humboldt-University in Berlin and spent a semester at LUISS Guido Carli in Rome. I have also done a research stay at the Department of Governance at the University of Vienna where I taught a seminar on "Comparative Politics".
