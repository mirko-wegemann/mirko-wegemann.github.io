    <h3>Content</h3><br>
    <p>This seminar deals with the (under)representation of women in politics. The course follows an empirical, comparativist approach. After reaching a basic understanding of crucial concepts in the study of gender, we will assess how a lack of women in politics translates into a gap in substantive representation. Moreover, we will assess how gender norms, a crucial determinant of women's underrepresentation in politics, are transmitted intergenerationally. In the second part of the seminar, we will read several papers that test how gender inequalities are affected by cultural and institutional factors, and how how gender gaps are maintained through demand- and supply-side dynamics. In a final block, we will critically evaluate different mechanisms tackling gender inequalities in politics, such as quotas, role models and language.  </p>

	<h3>Material</h3>
	<br>
	<h4>Week 1: Introduction (09 April 2025)</h4>
	In this session, we will get to know each other and discuss some logistics about the seminar. Moreover, a brief introduction into the topic is given.  <br>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}assets/pdf/gap25/introduction.pdf">Slides</a><br><br>
	<h4>Week 2: Concepts</h4>
	We will talk about about comparison in political science. Moreover, we will introduce crucial concepts in the study of gender in politics.  <br>

    <h4>Week 3: Representation</h4>
	This week, we deal with different conceptualizations of representation and debate whether descriptive representation can foster gender equality in politics. <br>

    <h4>Week 4: Norms</h4>
    Norms are essential for social order. They shape how we think and behave. In this week, we'll discuss what norms are, how they evolve and how they are transmitted to the next generation while discussing their significance in the context of gender. <br> 
    <a href="{{ site.url }}assets/pdf/gap25/norms.pdf">Slides</a><br><br>
     <h4>Week 5: Legacies</h4>
    How do gender norms come into being? We focus on an application of cultural transmission, arguing that an agricultural reform -- the emergence of the plough -- has reinforced gendered household division with lasting effects up until today. <br>

    <h4>Week 6: Institutions</h4>
    This week, we discuss the role of political institutions, such as the electoral system and the candidate selection process, for the participation and representation of women in politics. <br>

    <h4>Week 7: Demand-side biases</h4>
    Do voters discriminate against female candidates? In this session, we will discuss, based on different survey experiment on voters' perceptions of political candidates, whether voters attach different levels of competency and expertise to female candidates than to male candidates, and how this shapes their political persuasion.  <br>

    <h4>Week 8: Candidates</h4>
    Prior to this week, we have assumed that women are actually considering running for office. This week, we will analyse how structural factors reduce women's expressive ambition to run for office.  <br>

     <h4>Week 9: Institutional Fixes</h4>
    From this week onwards, we evaluate different tweaks that are (un)intentionally designed to improve women's representation. This week, we'll focus on institutions.  <br>

     <h4>Week 10: Role Models</h4>
    Do women in office serve as role models for potential future female candidates? In this session, we will assess the idea of "critical masses", and how they (might) contribute to women's decision of pursuing a political career. <br>
    <a href="{{ site.url }}assets/pdf/gap25/role_models.pdf">Slides</a><br><br>
     <h4>Week 11: Language</h4>
    How does language affect our thinking, and does gender-inclusive language change mental representations about gendered stereotypes? This week, we will assess the current prevalence of gender-inclusive language in the public discourse and its effect on the masses. <br>

    <h4>Week 12: Wrap-Up</h4>
    In our final session, we discuss students' term paper ideas. Moreover, we'll take time to reflect on our learning outcomes. <br>
