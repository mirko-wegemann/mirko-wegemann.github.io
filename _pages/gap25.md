    <h3>Content</h3><br>
    <p>This seminar deals with the (under)representation of women in politics. The course follows an empirical, comparativist approach. After reaching a basic understanding of crucial concepts in the study of gender, we will assess how a lack of women in politics translates into a gap in substantive representation. Moreover, we will assess how gender norms, a crucial determinant of women's underrepresentation in politics, are transmitted intergenerationally. In the second part of the seminar, we will read several papers that test how gender inequalities are affected by cultural and institutional factors, and how how gender gaps are maintained through demand- and supply-side dynamics. In a final block, we will critically evaluate different mechanisms tackling gender inequalities in politics, such as quotas, role models and language.  </p>

    <h4>Week 4: Norms</h4>
    Norms are essential for social order. They shape how we think and behave. In this week, we'll discuss what norms are, how they evolve and how they are transmitted to the next generation while discussing their significance in the context of gender. <br>
