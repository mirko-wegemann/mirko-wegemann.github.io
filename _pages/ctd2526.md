    <h3>Content</h3><br>
    <p>The seminar seeks to analyse the current challenges democratic regimes face. It is structured along three blocks. In the first block, we will learn about the essential features of a democracy and discover what shapes the quality of democracy. In a second block, we will engage with different empirical analyses of the current state of democratization and democratic systems. We will zero in on how institutions are sidelined; how actors, such as far-right parties, challenge democracies; and how democracy is threatened by crises. In the third block, we will look at potential solutions and scenarios of how democracy could cope with the current challenges. </p>

<h4>Week 2: Concepts</h4>
This week is all about conceptualizing democracy. We will discuss different levels of abstraction in defining democracy and talk about the tension between some democratic 
principles.

	<br>
	<h4>Week 3: Democracy - A Winning Formula?</h4>
	We will discuss Fukuyama's influential work on "The End of History" and compare it with recent developments around the globe. What's the state of democracy nowadays? Moreover, the 
session will introduce students to different sources measuring the quality of democracy, which they can apply for their own projects.

	<br>
	<h4>Week 5: Challenges and Facilitators of Democratization (Part 1)</h4>
	In this week, we will discuss potential causes of democratization. Moreover, we will engage with empirical articles that focus on facilitators and challenges of democratization. <br>

 	<br>
 	<h4>Week 9: Global Crises</h4>
 	Crises resulting from a pandemic, economic recessions or climate change require appropriate governance. In this session, we will discuss the tension between the climate crisis and the future of democracy. <br>

	<br>
	<h4>Week 10: Strengthening Institutions </h4>
	Institutions are key when analysing democratic backsliding. But could these be strengthened to safeguard democracy from erosion?<br>

	<br>
	<h4>Week 11: Strengthening Political Participation</h4>

	<h4>Week 13: The Far-Right</h4>
	In this concluding session, we will do a session on the far-right, initially planned to be held in week 6. We'll talk about definitions, ways to explain their success, how they constitute a threat to democracy and how mainstream democrats are contributing to their success.
