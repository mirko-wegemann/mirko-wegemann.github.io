<strong>Going Local? How Mainstream Parties React to the Local Framing of Migration by the Radical Right.</strong><br>
<em> Draft available upon request </em><br>
<blockquote> 
<p> <strong><em> Abstract:</strong></em> The radical right has played a crucial role in the politicization of migration, particularly on the national
level, where their success has often pushed mainstream parties to adopt similar tough stances on migration.
Despite stark regional differences in the electoral appeal of radical right parties, there is a lack of research
of the local dynamics of this phenomenon. Consequently, this article challenges the prevailing national perspective
on party competition by investigating how the discourse on migration plays out at the local level. In
a first step, this paper analyses whether radical right parties adjust their communication to the local context.
While these parties portray migration mainly as a cultural threat, it is expected that they highlight economic
aspects of migration in economically deprived constituencies. In a second step, this paper zeroes in on the
consequences of radical right’s communication on migration for local party competition. It is explored how
centre-left and centre-right parties respond to the framing of the radical right and whether their responses
vary at the local level. I hypothesize that the reaction of mainstream parties hinges on the electoral threat
posed by the radical right. It is argued that the more electorally threatening radical right candidates are, the
more centre-left and centre-right candidates adopt the cultural ‘master’ frame of the radical right. The empirical
analysis draws on a newly compiled dataset consisting of Twitter posts by candidates running in the
2017 and 2021 German parliamentary elections, as well as state-level members of parliament. The framing
of these posts is identified with the help of large language models and matched with contextual data of candidates’
constituencies. The results show that the radical right often relies on a nationalist and identity-based
framing of migration, which becomes more pronounced in districts with high migration levels. While the
cultural context affects their framing of migration, radical right parties do not react to economic grievances
by using more economic frames of migration. Regarding local patterns of party competition, this paper refines
existing findings from a national level. In constituencies where the radical right has become electorally
successful, centre-left parties put more salience on migration whereas centre-right parties increasingly adopt
cultural frames of migration. The findings of this article contribute to the literature by emphasizing the importance
of local party competition in an era of growing party system fragmentation. </p>
